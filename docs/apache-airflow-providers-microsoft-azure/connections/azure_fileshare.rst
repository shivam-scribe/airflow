Microsoft Azure File Share Connection
=====================================

The Microsoft Azure File Share connection type enables the Azure File Share Integrations.

Authenticating to Azure File Share
----------------------------------

There are four ways to connect to Azure File Share using Airflow.

1. Use `token credentials
   <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/identity/azure-identity>`_
   i.e. add specific credentials (client_id, secret) and subscription id to the Airflow connection.
2. Use a `SAS Token
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview>`_
   i.e. add a key config to ``sas_token`` in the Airflow connection.
3. Use a `Connection String
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string>`_
   i.e. add connection string to ``connection_string`` in the Airflow connection.

Only one authorization method can be used at a time. If you need to manage multiple credentials or keys then you should
configure multiple connections.

Default Connection IDs
----------------------

All hooks and operators related to Azure File Share use ``azure_fileshare_default`` by default.

Configuring the Connection
--------------------------

Login (optional)
    Specify the login used for azure blob storage. For use with Shared Key Credential and SAS Token authentication.

Password (optional)
    Specify the password used for azure blob storage. For use with
    Active Directory (token credential) and shared key authentication.

Host (optional)
    Specify the account url for anonymous public read, Active Directory, shared access key authentication.

Extra (optional)
    Specify the extra parameters (as json dictionary) that can be used in Azure connection.
    The following parameters are all optional:

    * ``connection_string``: Connection string for use with connection string authentication.
    * ``sas_token``: SAS Token for use with SAS Token authentication.

When specifying the connection in environment variable you should specify
it using URI syntax.

Note that all components of the URI should be URL-encoded.

For example connect with token credentials:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AIRFLOW_CONN_WASP_DEFAULT='azure_fileshare://blob%20username@myblob.com?sas_token=token'
